This repository contains two applications as part of the Zeotap Intern Assignment:

1. **Rule Engine with AST**: A rule engine that dynamically creates, combines, and evaluates rules using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
2. **Real-Time Weather Data Processing System**: A real-time weather monitoring system that fetches data from OpenWeatherMap and provides daily weather summaries and alerts.

- **Combine Rules**: Combine rules using `AND` or `OR`.
- **Evaluate Rules**: Evaluate if user data meets the defined rules.
